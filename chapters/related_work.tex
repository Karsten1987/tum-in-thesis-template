do I have to do this??

\section{Camera Models}

In order to utilise a camera as a sensor, a mapping between camera coordinates and world coordinates
needs to be derived.  To achieve this mapping a model of the camera is required.  This section will
cover all the different types of cameras used in this work and corresponding camera models for
each.
