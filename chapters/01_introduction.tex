Here starts the thesis with an introduction. Please use nice latex and bibtex entries \cite{latex}. 

\section{Motivation}

Outdoor SLAM for cars, lawnmowers, UAV's, trucks, tractors etc. etc.

Mention the accuracy required for autonomous driving.  Soeren probably has a good idea.

\section{Problem Statement}

Investigate Multiple Camera setup for visual SLAM.
