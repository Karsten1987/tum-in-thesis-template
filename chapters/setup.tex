\chapter{System Setup}
\label{chapter:system_setup}

This will cover the setup I used to record data.  Here is gets a little dicey with respect to not
disclosing information about the car.  I plan to handle this by talking to the full extent about my
cameras only.  I will not talk about IMU's GPS, ADMA, laser localization etc, as this does not get
integrated with my work. I only use it as ground truth, so therefore I will simply refer to a black
box ground truth machine.

Quick summary of the contents of this chapter

\begin{itemize}
 \item cameras, mounts
 \item camera calibration/extrinsics - this will be a big one
 \item RAID array because its awesome
 \item groundtruth blackbox
 \item planned routes
 \item driving conditions
 \item size, time, length etc.
\end{itemize}
