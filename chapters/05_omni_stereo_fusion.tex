\section{Extrinsics for multiple camera systems}

In order to combine cameras together in one framework, extrinsic calibration between cameras needs
to be done.  This section will cover that extrinsic calibration.

\subsection{Extrinsic Calibration}

Explain the algorithm we used from ROS

\subsection{Undistorted Perspective Image from Omni-Camera}

Alex's work.
Theory to get a rectified perspective image from donut image for calibration

\section{Omni loop closure}

\subsection{Place Recognition}

Place recog with omni images

\subsection{Scale Correction algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
 \item omni-omni matching
 \item 5 point algorithm, transformation and 3d points
 \item circular matching between left/right/omni
 \item re triangulate points which are matched with stereo
 \item calculate scale offset by comparing 3d stereo point with non metric triangulated point
 \item repeat over all points, calculate a robust mean scale offset
 \item apply offset to transform from omni-omni. Add it to the graph
\end{itemize}
