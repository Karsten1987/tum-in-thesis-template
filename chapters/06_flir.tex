\chapter{Infra Red Camera}
\label{chapter:flir}

I spent a bunch of time on the flir place recognition evaluation, not to mention recorded a
bunch of data and made a bunch of screenshots.  Although the quantitative results are terrible due
to flir image quality, I would like to add this to my thesis as it is somewhat relevant.
