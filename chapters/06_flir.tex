\chapter{Infra Red Camera}
\label{chapter:flir}

I did spend a bunch of time on this, in terms of system engineering, recording data, analysing
data, making screenshots etc.  It would be good if this could be used, however as discussed it is
somewhat off topic and not consistent with the rest of the thesis.  Also the quantitative
results are so bad they are unusable.  Leave this here as a placeholder for now.
