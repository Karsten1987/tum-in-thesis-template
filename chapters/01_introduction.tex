\label{chapter:Introduction}

Here starts the thesis with an introduction. Please use nice latex and bibtex entries \cite{latex}. 

\section{Motivation}

Outdoor SLAM for cars, lawnmowers, UAV's, trucks, tractors etc. etc.

Mention the accuracy required for autonomous driving.  Soeren probably has a good idea.

\section{Problem Statement}

Investigate Multiple Camera setup for visual SLAM.

\section{Outline}
 
Chapter 2 describes Theory and algorithms required by this work.  \newline
Chapter 3 describes the motivation for omni-stereo fusion and why the selected approach was chosen.
\newline
Chapter 4 describes the SLAM system that was used and extended for this work \newline
Chapter 5 describes the algorithm and implementation of the omni-stereo fusion \newline
Chapter 6 describes using an infra red camera to help address the issue of localizing against a map
that was created with different lighting conditions to that what is being sensed.\newline
Chapter 7 describes the software architecture used throughout this work \newline
Chapter 8 describes the hardware setup used to record data \newline
Chapter 9 is an evaluation of the presented omni-stereo fusion algorithm \newline
