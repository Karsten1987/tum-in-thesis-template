\chapter{System Setup}
\label{chapter:system_setup}

This will cover the setup I used to record data.  Here is gets a little dicey with respect to not
disclosing information about the car.  I plan to handle this by talking to the full extent about my
cameras only.  I will not talk about IMU's GPS, ADMA, laser localization etc, as this does not get
integrated with my work. I only use it as ground truth, so therefore I will simply refer to a black
box ground truth machine.
\newline
Talk to jan about how much I can talk about the groundtruth
\newline
Describe the groundtruth at a very high level - highly accurate post processed GPS with so and so
accuarcy
