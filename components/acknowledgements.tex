I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the thesis in any way.

Special thanks to Alex for all his work on the projective model for the omni camera.  Not to mention helping with all camera calibrations, setting up, recording datasets and his work with the UVM Library.  Also thanks for the mountain biking, and pulling me out of the office on those late evenings.

Thanks Matt for supervising, teaching me so much on SLAM theory, helping me learn more about g2o and guiding me at the start of my internship.  

I would like to especially thank Matthias for all the help at Bosch; with supervising and teaching me so much about SLAM, computer vision, etc. and the support in completing my Master thesis.  I very much enjoyed the many technical discussions, coffee breaks, and not to mention sharing my excitement over cool and silly visualizations.

Big thanks to Dejan for his supervision throughout my entire Master's program, and for encouraging me to do an internship at Bosch.  I am sure I wouldn't have achieved what I did without his guidance, and I am grateful for that. 

My gratitude goes to the whole driving team; Jan, Chris, Kevin, Shilpa, Soeren, Phillip and Aaron.  I very much enjoyed my time as an intern in the team; it was a fantastic working atmosphere.  Thank you for the patience and support particularly in the final stages of my thesis.


Sebastian thanks for the help with drafting diagrams and latex tips. My thesis would never had looked so good without the advice.

A special thanks goes to my good friend Karol, who was there as a friend and colleague throughout the entire Master's program and internship.  

Thank you all the other interns and everyone else in the office; Fadri, Kai, Andy, David, Jeff, Raph, Tatiana, Stephan, Shane, Rainer, Tomek, Walter, Thomas, Tina, Hannes, Carmen, Alwin, and anyone else I didn't mention.  Thanks for the casual discussions, technical discussions, coffee breaks, lunch breaks, weekend trips or the sacred foosball games.

Also thanks go to Tom and Florian for helping me through the very final stages of my thesis.  It was very much appreciated.

Finally, thanks to my Family; Mum, Dad, Angela and Stephanie.  Also thanks to Michael.  Your support so far away from home means a lot to me.
