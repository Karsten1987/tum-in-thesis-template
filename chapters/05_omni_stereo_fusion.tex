\chapter{Omni Stereo Camera Fusion}
\label{chapter:omni_stereo_fusion}

Add in calibration of stereo/omni here i.e. Alex's work

Theory to get a rectified perspective image from donut image for calibration

This chapter will outline my pipeline.  To summarize:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
 \item omni-omni matching
 \item 5 point algorithm, transformation and 3d points
 \item circular matching between left/right/omni
 \item re triangulate points which are matched with stereo
 \item calculate scale offset by comparing 3d stereo point with non metric triangulated point
 \item repeat over all points, calculate a robust mean scale offset
 \item apply offset to transform from omni-omni. Add it to the graph
\end{itemize}
