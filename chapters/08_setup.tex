\chapter{System Setup}
\label{chapter:system_setup}

This will cover the setup I used to record data.  Here is gets a little dicey with respect to not
disclosing information about the car.  I plan to handle this by talking to the full extent about my
cameras only.  I only use other sensors for groundtruth so it doesn't need to be covered in
detail.  I will cover it at a very high level e.g. 'High Accuracy GPS with x cm accuarcy'.  Check
with Jan about this.

Quick summary of the contents of this chapter

\begin{itemize}
 \item cameras, mounts
 \item setup for calibrating camera.  As opposed to the theory in chapter 5, talk about what we
actually did, i.e. wave checkerboards around
 \item RAID array because its awesome
 \item groundtruth 
 \item planned routes
 \item driving conditions
 \item size, time, length etc.
\end{itemize}

Potential Datasets:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item carpark with matt's route - demonstrate graph getting tighter
 \item backstreets with opposite direction loop closures only.  This will ideally show a HUGE
difference in accuarcy
\end{enumerate}
