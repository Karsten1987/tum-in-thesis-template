\section{3D geometry}

Yes  - do coordinate systems, transformations, notation
Brief description of SE(3) and SO(3)

\section{Camera Models}

In order to utilise a camera as a sensor, a mapping between camera coordinates and world coordinates
needs to be derived.  To achieve this mapping a model of the camera is required.  This section will
cover all the different types of cameras used in this work and corresponding camera models for
each.

\section{Computer Vision Basics}

\subsection{Feature point detection and extraction}

Outline what is feature point detection, description and matching, why we need it.  Mention SIFT
and SURF and cite them.  Mention that we used a GPU implemtation of SIFT, cite the ETH paper. 
Mention a bunch of other descriptors, cite them as well.

\subsection{RANSAC}

explain this cos its easy and fun.  Cite a paper

\subsection{Geometry estimation}

\subsubsection{5 point algorithm}

ask for matthias for relavent literature

\section{Place Recognition}

Bag of words

\section{Visual SLAM}

Cover this in abstract terms.  Talk about the theory, not implemtation.  Mention PTAM and cite it.
